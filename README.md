## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```sh
pip install matplotlib numpy
```

## Questions

1. **Line Graph**: Plot a line graph showing the relationship between x (from 0 to 10) and y = xÂ². Use a green color for the line. Label the axes and give the plot a title.
2. **Bar Plot**: Create a bar plot to represent the sales data for different products in a store. The product names are `['Product A', 'Product B', 'Product C', 'Product D']` and their corresponding sales are `[100, 250, 150, 300]`. Use a blue-to-red color gradient for the bars.
3. **Scatter Plot**: Create a scatter plot that shows the relationship between two lists of numbers: `x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`. Add a title, labels for the x and y axes, and a grid. Use red for the data points and change the marker style to stars.
4. **Pie Chart**: Plot a pie chart that represents the market share of five companies with the following market shares: `[30, 20, 25, 15, 10]`. Add labels for each company and a legend. Assign custom colors for each slice, such as light blue, dark green, yellow, orange, and purple.
5. **Subplots**: Create two subplots:
   - One for a line graph representing `y = sin(x)`, using a blue color for the line.
   - Another for a bar plot comparing the heights of different cities, using green bars.
   - Display the plots in a `1x2` grid.

## Usage
Clone this repository and run the Python scripts to generate the plots.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/matplotlib-graphs.git
cd matplotlib-graphs
python plot_script.py
```
